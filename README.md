# WebCalculator
Hello everyone, welcome to my calculator. I have made it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.This happens to be my first project on github and I am very exicted to share it on github.
I still do not know much about github features but I am exploring them thus please wish me luck ✌️!

Now actually I do not have much words nor this simple project as calculator needs much explaination but since this is my first project that I am uploading on github I tried to write long.

# What is a calculator?
Wikipedia describes an electronic calculator as typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
My calculator will be a simplier version software.

# What does this calculator do?
This calculator takes digits 0-9 and operation "+", "_", "*", "/" as input and calculates the result when pressed "=" . It also has a feature of clearing the screen when "clear" is pressed.

# What this calculator made of?
This calculator is made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Brief explaination about coding part

HTML: It uses a "conatiner" class div to represent the outer box of calculator and inside it I have rows flexed as columns. Futher inside each row I have div of "element" class, and 2 div of different class flexed as rows to represent buttons on my calculator. I could have also used actually buttons as alternatives.
I used input field for displayscreen beacuse I thought it opened more room for futher enchancements if I were to ever do, also there was no harm in doing so. 

CSS: For decoration I tried giving neon glow to my calculator.Flexing i had already explained in HTML part so that the idea is more clear which div had beend flexed and how.

JavaScript: The javascipt part was where I got stuck the most, of course I got little stuck at flexbox too. In JavaScript after some search I removed repetition of using every different "element" div numbers to simply selecting by classname and looping them one by one to add to input field. Only two "cleartab" and "equalto" were made of different class so the loop does not go over them.
